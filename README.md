# The Ultimate `go`-script

This repository contains a template `go`-script for you to use in your project root to have a common entry-point for your project tooling.

## What is a `go`-script?

See Pete Hodgsons blog-posts on the topic: [part 1](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-i) and [part 2](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/praise-go-script-part-ii)

## Usage

* Copy [`go.example.sh`](./go.example.sh) into your project
* Add custom commands to it and modify the code in whatever way works for you - it's an example, not a reusable library

## Development

Use this projects `./go`-script to run tests, lint and more.
